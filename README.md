# SpotifyMapping
A program that takes your Spotify listening history and maps it into a neat node graph

# Example Node Graph
Although each iteration of this project will present a different variant of a similar graph, here is a great example of the end result.

# Example Bar Graph
Since the node graph, I've added a frequency chart of the last **10** songs of your Spotify history, since 50 songs would make the x-axis too cluttered. Even with 10 songs, the x-axis is still a little cluttered.
